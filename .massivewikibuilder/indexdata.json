        "body": "# Wikis and knowledge structures\n- [[Peter Kaminski]]: [CSC Agora posts](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/1p4srzocgt8bzd9ut1xfmo476e):\n\nAnd now, a mostly new riff. It doesn't quite capture what I want to say right yet, but I'm hitting Send now and hope it grows up (perhaps on the conversations wiki! :-))\n\n(Jordan asked, \"Do both wikis and science require ontologies to structure knowledge? Why?\")\n\nWe've been grappling with the need -- or not -- for a taxonomy in a Massive Wiki. This got in our face early on because Obsidian, our primary MW client right now, has a very nice file-oriented page navigator built into it, which lets you do hierarchical taxonomy the way you've been doing it since you learned how to do computers, however long ago that was.\n\nTurned out that hierarchical taxonomy is sort of a blind alley -- or a crutch, that you need if you're storing physical things like paper and books in physical things like file cabinets or libraries.\n\nWhat I've been saying to MW folks lately is that relationship (context) is how you find, remember, and communicate with your past self / future self, and with other people. And, that relationship, for humans, is also contextualized in conversations and stories.\n\nAn ontology, or better, ontologies, _is/are_ needed to structure knowledge. Ontologies work for knowledge the way grammar works for languages. Without a grammar, the way words tumble out of your mouth may or may not make sense even to yourself; they probably won't make sense to someone else.\n\nAnd surprise, I think if you and someone else stuck on a desert island chattered to each other long enough, you would start to make sense to each other; but, in doing so, you would have instantiated a grammar that both of you can understand. Similarly, if you and your desert island friend started keeping knowledge in a wiki long enough, you'll start to make sense; and in doing so, you will have instantiated an ontology.\n\nNeither of you might be consciously aware of the grammar or the ontology you've elicited out of the chattering, but I assert that even if you can't articulate the shape of it, you have a grammar or an ontology.\n\nA taxonomy is less important, unless you're dealing with massive amounts of things that need categorization and hierarchy, like species of living things.\n\nIf and when you start a taxonomy, you've started to create limits and boundaries to the way you can perceive and reason about the things you're working with. So, it's good not to over-taxonomize. It may help to use more than one taxonomy. (In a wiki, it's easy to fit things into multiple taxonomies at the same time, unlike pieces of paper or books.)\n\nBut in general, think about the way things are connected, and how to tell stories and make conversations around that. That's how humans really work under the hood.\n\nAnd more: how do you frame up the knowledge you have and want to grow?\n\nIn conversation, in real time, and creating artifacts (wiki pages, diagrams, terminology, ontology) as you converse.\n\nIt seems that you want at least 3 people in a conversation.\n\nThe act of explaining to each other what you mean, as you create or morph the artifacts, helps you know what to build. And you just fractally scale up from there.\n\nHumans are pretty good at doing this natively, without much training or experience. But, like anything else, it helps if you've got some participants who do have experience in organizing and sensemaking; you can save a lot of simple mistakes and rework that way. As long as you don't turn over the whole process to experts; it's important that many people, with many backgrounds, participate.\n\nRelated posts:\n- [[Ontology (back to basics)]]\n\n"

The Canonical Debate Lab has been doing well in this area (not by me) by crafting documents in the meetings. Not notes but specific documents with specific purposes which are updated during and between calls. Maybe updating a wiki of active content instead (in addition to)  call notes.\n\n[Ken wrote](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/yfpy6wuabfbyxfa3m4qz73tkby),\n\nThanks Pete for these provocative thoughts. Lauren and Charles did some fantastic work in creattng Miro board for Cicolab. Once I got some basic skills in using Miro, I found using it live with others was a  powerful tool for collective mapping and note-taking - which, in theory, can be a powerful adjunct to collective sense and meaning making. Something I learned long ago in my early days at the World Cafe was the power of having visual facilitation, aka, graphic recorders, who would capture and display various aspects of the group conversation creating, along the way, a map of the major points and the relationships between them. I think that with practice, we could use Miro for much the same purpose - to map out the big outlines and show the relationships between differing ideas and perspectives. So, it seems to me that forming a team of people who would like to learn how to use Miro and who are interested in mapping would be a great step along the way and it's something that I would like to do with others. Anyone else?\n\n[Charles wrote](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/ora8nh5qxjyxfpmxghx3rwy37c),\n\n have plenty of thoughts on all this \ud83d\ude42\n and a few protocols largely untested \n\ni daresay the imperative is the DKR-NIC with IF sprinkled liberally\n\ndynamic knowledge repository(DKR)  networked improvement community(NIC)  interoperability flow(IF) \u2014 values/ patterns of collaboration \n\n[Hank wrote](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/qr3sjujipfb7igjg7pzbbm1kdh),\n\nVery thought provoking conversation starting up here. I absolutely agree with you, Pete, when you say, \" we would learn more and think more together, by doing it ourselves, rather than depending on an external specialist to do it for us\". And lots of us are doing it in different ways. We only have to bring this collective eperience into our 'commons'. visual facilitation, as Ken writes, is a very powerful tool. The Positive Cartography process I am co-developing is based on using visual images to help people tell their stories - and doing it on Miro. Miro may not be the best platform for mapping relationships between ideas and perspectives, but it it easy to use (no big learning curve) and does the job sufficiently to start with. I can share some of our work in progress here - and later. For example, the photo I just oploaded as the Miro board seeded with photos for late September's Mapathon 21. And this past week, somehing similar for a workshop on Futures of Sustainable business with Norwegin entrepreneurs etc.\n\n![[/_attachments/Mapathon 21 Start Template.png]]\n\nI woiuld welcome co-creators and prototypers to make this 'mapping' process more effective. So I'll join your 'team of people who would like to learn how to use Miro and who are interested in mapping', Ken\n\n[Hank wrote](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/7zfjuhoxtp8pdfaqehen1g9uro),\n\nAnd your teams, Pete, of people doing collective intelligence and collective wisdom together. To reply to the question \"what do we want to do, together?\" I would propose, (1st step) Take an issue of mutual interest, (to my mind a social or societal challenge), and map the existing technologies worldwide, already in use (or on drawing boards somewhere), that can be used to address it. Then (2nd step) map 'best and worst practice'. Then (3rd step) consolidate 'collective intelligence' and apply it in practice to a real-world situation, in one or several of our cities. Or something along these lines\n\n[Rob wrote](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/jj6nzm3gatr1inecwqb7asx3rc),\n\ni like the idea of a Miro board -- we would need some ground rules, can you move, edit, delete other people stuff. For me it would work better to have asynchronous work time and then syncronous time (cxalls). I like the idea of one topic per board. there would have to be some focus or it might sprawl. Pete, what would be the goal... to record? to share? to Sense-make?\n\n[Pete wrote](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/jwfzgkwakpyhtpc19jrfiufpjo),\n\nRob, I like the idea of a Miro board, too. We have the CICOLAB experience with it, and we have at least several people who feel comfortable with it.\n\nEven better, I'm not very good with Miro, so I won't get out ahead of other folks so much as I might in another medium. :slightly_smiling_face:\n\nThe overarching goals for me:\n\n-   collective memory\n-   increased collective intelligence\n-   more collective and collaborative thinking and doing\n\nFor OGM, and other communities, I'd like there to be a community memory/brain, that contains \"what does the community remember\", and \"what is the community thinking about\".\n\nThe best tools for a community brain will allow the community to _think_ together asynchronously in the information space, over a variety of time scales, from short (hours and days) to long (weeks, months, even years).\n\nI really want to emphasize the community part. A good community brain is accessible to most of the community, and is edited by many in the community. It represents persistent, accretive knowledge and wisdom, of the entire group.\n\nWe already have knowledge artifacts -- YouTube videos, Otter or AWS transcripts, Jerry's Brain, meeting notes in OGM wiki. Each is a snapshot of what the group was thinking during a call. But they are not an interactive, living collaboration space, where the group remembers and thinks together.\n\nSo that's what I want. A community brain, where we remember together, and think together, in a way that's accessible and used by most of the group. Bonus points if that's in the public commons.\n\nI was inspired to complain this past Thursday because I had been reading this [Alan Kay interview in Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now).\n\nKay talks about \"oral society\" being one of the human universals -- something that humans do naturally.\n\nThings like reading, writing, drawing (and more -- agriculture, deductive mathematics, empirical science, equal rights, etc.) are _invented_ technologies, that allow humans to reach another level.\n\nEngaging in another level of thought takes practice and effort, because it requires using our invented technologies on top of our natural, built-in ability to do oral culture.\n\nIt feels to me like OGM -- like much of the world, even the corporate world -- is an oral culture. We tell stories, and hopes and dreams and fears to each other.\n\nSome of us write some of those things down.\n\nBut we don't have a culture of writing them down _together_. Of reading them back to each other, _together_.\n\nUntil we do, we're missing out on an opportunity to level up our thinking, to become collectively intelligent, rather than just individually intelligent.\n\n## Multiplexing Between Talking (easy) and Writing (harder)\n\n### _and between expounding (easy) and reflecting (harder)_\n\nIt's hard to write things down as you're talking, and only a little less hard when you're trying to listen.\n\nWendy Elford and Bill Anderson and I (Pete) have been exploring this tension, and have observed that if you have one person talking, one person listening, and one person trying to keep up with written notes, it's easier than if you just have one person talking and one person listening and trying to write notes.\n\n(Another thing we've noticed is that a three-person conversation feels more collaborative than a two-person conversation. Two-person conversations are wonderful, of course, but they end up being \"intimate\" and harder to share, because a lot of the conversation happens within the context of shared language and tacit knowledge. When you get the three people, the conversation is more shareable, because the conversation naturally ends up being more in the context of social knowledge, rather than private knowledge. (I think Bill knows of a connection here between the number three we came up with, and [[The Art of Gathering]], by [[Priya Parker]].))\n\nI think another thing that eases the tension between talking and writing notes when Wendy and Bill and I talk, is that we have an unwritten rule to take turns -- moving the talking, listening, and writing roles around, usually at the end of each expository turn. I don't know if we do a great job of it, but if we did, it would help.\n\nI wanted to compare and contrast several ways of \"taking turns\" talking and writing.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, we could have a meeting -- say, an OGM Thursday call -- where one person checks in by talking, with one or several topics. Jerry and maybe a few other folks respond, by talking. A few more people respond to _that_, by talking.\n\nA few of us write a few things -- a short, pithy phrase, or a link to something relevant, in chat. Other topics are bubbling in the chat, too.\n\nWe move on to the next check-in. And the next, and the next.\n\nAt the end, Mark Carranza has his MX session; Jerry has curated some more links between thoughts in his Brain, there is a long, messy (not meant pejoratively) chat. The audio-video recording is posted to YouTube, the zoom chat is available somewhere, as perhaps is a machine transcription by Otter or AWS.\n\nSomething we could do afterwards, but haven't very much, is to \"harvest\" all the exciting news and thinking from that call. Let's have one (or several) persons listen to the whole call, and try to map out what was talked about, what the group thought, or might have been thinking about.\n\nI've done this for a number of zoom calls (some OGM, some other formats). I can attest that for me, I need to feel like I understand precisely what words were said, before I can dig into a higher level understanding of what was said, and even starting with a machine transcription, it can take me a couple hours per hour of recording to feel like I have a \"clean\" transcript. To sensemake after that, to make a thought-map or idea-map or knowledge-map, could take a few more hours, at least.\n\nAlong with just the time investment, with post hoc harvesting, there's no way to be interactive. \"Did you mean _this_ or _that_?\" \"Did you consider this other thing?\" \"How do you think that relates to our previous understanding....\" \"Hey X, what did you think about what Y just said?\" Etc.\n\nAt the end of a harvesting session, the harvester(s) have become very familiar with the material, but all of the sensemaking they did happened in their heads. It's very hard to convey out all the nuance that they were able to glean from the discussion. Sure, it's possible to write a summary, or even construct new narrative to explain what happened. But that has become knowledge archaeology; it is a rough picture of a tiny slice of what happened; it is not interactive knowledge.\n\nHaving explained that, I would like to wish not for \"harvesting\", but rather \"interactive knowledge creation\", with artifacts unfolding during the discussion. That's not to preclude subsequent asynchronous enrichment of the knowledge, but rather, to mesh real-time oral culture and asynchronous interaction, _starting at the point where we are co-braining in real-time_.\n\nI'm happier when the notes and the drawings and the diagrams are happening more or less simultaneously; or, at least, at the time scale of each small exposition, rather than happening ex parte, post hoc.\n\nI think that means that the conversation has to slow down, so the people performing the technology of writing, drawing, diagramming, weaving can keep up. I know that often, if feels like if we slow down the talking too much, we'll drain all of the energy and spontaneity out of it.\n\nI think that's not true; I think if we practice together, we be as productive, thoughtful, and spontaneous, and come out of conversations not just with a good feeling, but actual artifacts around which we can continue to remember, think, and evolve.\n\nI also know that practicing before we get good at it will feel unfamiliar, difficult, confusing, upsetting, and we'll wonder if it's even worth it.\n\n> (Bill) Pete has highlighted several ideas and practices that I want to re-enforce. First is the notion of \"interactive knowledge creation\", to led me to think of knowledge construction. We are trying to build some thing here that includes (1) some things that hang around, like wiki pages and (2) some practices we can explore, like \"co-braining\". Second is Pete's insight that our conversations will slow down. This will let us be more deliberate in taking actions, such as starting a new wiki, or of reaping a harvest from a collection of wiki pages or Mattermost or email posts. Third, and this just occurs to me, working this way will be supported by more conversations among several of us or between only two of us. Incorporating the results of those interactions will be another practice to explore.\n> > (Pete) \"... conversations will slow down. This will let us be more deliberate....\" Wendy Elford and I have been exploring some other techniques along with slowing down: preparing on the topic beforehand, so the discussion is more clear and clean (see [[Clean Language]]); taking strict turns, listening intently while one person speaks until they are done, without interrupting them; using VNC to \"single-track\" (and make the single-tracking very obvious) the process of taking text notes.\n> > I don't mention these to say that they're techniques for everyone, or for every context, but to provide some more examples of how to co-brain, or collaboratively construct with knowledge.\n\nLike learning and doing any technology -- playing the guitar, flying an airplane, drawing a portrait -- it takes time to get good at it. And some of us may never be great at a particular skill. But we can all aim for some literacy, some proficiency, at capturing and participating in technology-assisted knowledge, and I think it would reward us richly when we do."

Yields a dataset that is hard to incorporate into writing.\n- Writer: create long-form content (Nick's adjective is \"tonally consistent\")\n- Connector-Writer (this is NM's goal): create long-form and linked content to share.\n\t\nNick describes Databasing (usage, gah!) as this:\n\n> It directs your attention toward the activity of adding metadata; because if you don't add attributes, then your advanced queries won't do you any good, so, good luck finding whatever it is you're looking for! This forces you to add metadata and over-link everything, absolutely all the time. And all this attention directed towards adding attributes and metadata]l, is attention stolen from writing ... along with making everything harder to read and share with others.\n\n#### Pluses about Obsidian (that match positives about massive wikis)\n\n1. Local files\n2. File-based\n3. Plain text\n\n#### The 7 takeaways of this video (with added Bill comments):\n\n1. Our apps shape us in profound ways (well-known fact; good to be reminded)\n2. Roam encourages connecting & databasing (seems accurate)\n3. Obsidian encourages connecting & writing (seems a reasonable claim)\n4. One is not better than the other (Tired)\n5. The world has more \"Connector-writers\" than \"Connector-databasers\" (claim; want evidence)\n6. Obsidian is the best tool to allow \"Connector-writers\" to flourish (Obsidian seems like a good tool for this \"connecting-writing\" activity)\n7. Obsidian will overtake Roam in total users (empirical question)"

        "body": "# Chunking, naming, and linking\n\nPete likes to call this \"Chunking, naming, linking\", in that order. _(Why, Pete?)_\n\n## 2021-09-05 \"chunking, naming, and linking\" notions.\n\nThis page contains some preliminary thinking by [[Bill Anderson]].\n\n1. The ideas of \"chunking, naming, and linking\" are related to managing wiki contents, as well as information system architecture, design, and deployment. I have questions about each of these notions. These questions are also about [[classification]].\n\n2. First,\"chunking\": this is a term used in [[cog-sci]] to name the human mental work of putting ideas or text entities together under one category or in one place. Sometimes chunking requires breaking large items into smaller pieces; e.g., a large text document into separated sections, such as paragraphs, or even sentences or phrases.\n\t  - are all chunking schemes hierarchical? (Need to explore [[Faceted classification]])\n\t  - is tagging chunking? (Bill's friend [Marty McGowan](http://alum.mit.edu/www/martymcgowan) asserts that tags either name a collection or a property of an information item.)\n  \n  3. Second,  \"naming\": in computer-based information systems every item needs a name. The computer system needs ways of representing the digital items so that they can be accessed and maintained over time. And in our lived experience we use names to enable sharing our experiences of the world with each other.\n  \t- all names are arbitrary and socially determined\n  \t- naming schemes? whatever they are they need to be agreed upon to support long-lived linking.\n\n4. Third, \"linking\": in my mind this notion refers to practices of connecting separate information items by explicit relations (and relationships?).\n \n  - Zettelkasten: this [introduction](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) provides a generative description of the method.\n\n  - Unix OS file system: how files are managed in the directory system; how hierarchy of the file system is related to maintaince of file system integrity. (cf., [Bell System Technical Journal: The UNIX Operating System, July 1978](https://bandstands.praxis101.net/references/1978_ritchie_unixtimesharingsystem))\n\n  - linking on wikis and elsewhere: in order to link an item it needs a name, hence item 3, above. In the world-wide-web lands, links are represented by [[URIs URLs and URNs]].\n\n## 2021-09-17 \"wiki thoughts\"\n\nFollowing up on some thoughts from [[Peter Kaminski]].\n\n1. Information organization on a wiki is focused on linking and chunking rather than classification. Change that.\n\n2. Put ideas into a wiki page and create links for the associations the arise during the writing.\n    - (Speculation) This method will lead to a large number of linked pages, any of which could be turned into a primary essay. (One example of [[Bill Anderson]]'s notion of picking up a connected graph by one of the nodes and shaking to produce a hierarchy.)"
