## Obsidian -> Hugo options
2022-08-10: Bill started looking at Obsidian -> Hugo softwares and practices. It turns out that PK's MassiveWikiBuilder is a well thought out solution to the "now-how-do-i-publish-my-massive-wiki" question.

But here are a couple of links and notes from Bill's searchings
 - hugo-wikilinks: a module for Hugo to include wikilinks style to your content <https://github.com/milafrerichs/hugo-wikilinks> (n.b.: this has not been tested)
 - this may fix a problem that this "Obsidian Vault to Hugo Content" <https://github.com/devidw/obsidian-to-hugo> has with wiki-links. This software also shows several of the major breakdowns between MassiveWiki content generated in Obsidian, and the model that Hugo has for blog-style content.
