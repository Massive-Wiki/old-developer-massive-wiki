# wiki page name staring with an octothorpe

2022-08-02: created this page in Emacs. Could not do it in Obsidian, but, hey, maybe there are options to set in Obsidian to let that happen?

- so now the test is to see what happens when
  (1) I look at the vault in Obsidian, and
  (2) I run MWB to build the website
  - and the result is that I can see the note in Obsidian and MWB creates an html page that starts with `_` in place of `#`
