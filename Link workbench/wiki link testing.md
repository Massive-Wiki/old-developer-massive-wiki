# wiki link testing
### 2022-04-23
Here we are providing samples for fuzzy linking to other pages:

  - one at the root [[The Walrus]]
  - one in another folder [[Bill Anderson]]
  - one in this folder [[sameFolder note]]
  - one in a folder in a folder [[folder in a folder test page]]

First results:

 In the list above only the "one in this folder" link returns a wiki page; the other two links return "404"s because full wiki path links are missing.

Added folder in a folder note (to add one more level to the vault)
